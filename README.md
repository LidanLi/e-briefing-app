# E-Briefing Mobile App

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/framework) based mobile client for the [E-Briefing Service](https://github.com/cds-snc/e-briefing-service).

## Heads up!

This project is still early in development and some of the processes involved in running, installing, and loading data 
into the app are meant to be temporary work-arounds until a more full-featured product can be developed.

For instance, for local development, data must be manually downloaded from the service and loaded into the app before 
running it with `ionic serve`.  To install on a device, a `trip_id` must be obtained from the service and set in a 
global config file before compiling, and this can't be changed without recompiling.

There are also some challenges [loading the app onto a device](#loading-the-app-onto-a-device))

Only one briefing can be loaded on a device at a time, meaning that if you want to load a new briefing onto the device, 
you will have to recompile the app with the new `trip_id` and load it onto the device again.

These issues and more are outlined in a TODO file in the 
[E-Briefing Service Repository](https://github.com/cds-snc/e-briefing-service).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Install `ionic` and `cordova` globally

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
```

You must also generate and download a Trip Package from the service to install for local development.

## Installing a Trip (Local Development)

A Trip is made up of a collection of .json files and documents extracted from the E-Briefing Service.

After cloning this repository, you will need to generate and download a Trip content package from the E-Briefing
Service, then extract and install the Trip files into `www/data`.

The `www/data` folder should have the following structure:

```
- data
  - articles
    - #.json (one for each Article)
  - assets
    - documents
      - [UUID].pdf (one for each Document)
  - days
    - #.json (one for each Day of the Itinerary)
  - documents
    - #.json (one for each Document)
  - events
    - #.json (one for each Event)
  - people
    - #.json (one for each Person)
  - articles.json
  - days.json
  - documents.json
  - people.json
  - trip.json
```  

### Run in local web server:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

## Installing a Trip On Device

Data on the device is loaded in over the API on first run (and optionally updated through sync any time after).

Before compiling to run on a device or in an emulator, you must configure the following properties in the 
GlobalsProvider (`src/app/providers/globals`):

- `api_key`: to be obtained from the `users` table in the service database
- `api_url`: the base api url for the service
- `trip_id`: the `trip_id` for the briefing to be loaded onto the device

### Compile for ios:

```bash
$ ionic build
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova build ios
```

## Installing on a device

Currently we are using ad-hoc deployment for iOS devices.  This involves having direct access to the device as the 
device has to be registered with an Apple Developer Account.  Then the `trip_id` is set in globals, the app is compiled, 
signed, and packaged in XCode, and copied directly to the device.

### Cross-platform

Since the client is built with Ionic, the app can be deployed to a variety of devices including Blackberry,
Android, iOS, and Windows devices.  It could even be run as a Web Application and accessed through a browser.
