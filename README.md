# E-Briefing Mobile App

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/framework) based mobile client for the [E-Briefing Service](https://github.com/cds-snc/e-briefing-service).

## Working with this app

Install `ionic` and `cordova` globally

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

## Installing a Trip

A Trip is made up of a collection of .json files and documents extracted from the E-Briefing Service.

After cloning this repository, you will need to generate and download a Trip content package from the E-Briefing
Service, then extract and install the Trip files in www/data.

The data folder should have the following structure:

```
- data
  - articles
    - #.json (one for each Article)
  - assets
    - documents
      - [UUID].pdf (one for each Document)
  - days
    - #.json (one for each Day of the Itinerary)
  - documents
    - #.json (one for each Document)
  - events
    - #.json (one for each Event)
  - people
    - #.json (one for each Person)
  - articles.json
  - days.json
  - documents.json
  - people.json
  - trip.json
```

The `trip.json` contains a reference to the Trip on the server.  

Once the Trip has been loaded onto the device, the Trip that was loaded can be updated with over-the-air syncing.

## Compile for ios:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova build ios
```

## ...or run in local web server:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

## Loading the app onto a device

Currently we are using ad-hoc deployment for iOS devices.  This involves having direct access to the device as the 
device has to be registered with an Apple Developer Account.  Then the trip package is loaded into the data directory, 
 the app is compiled, signed, and packaged in XCode, and copied directly to the device.

## Cross-platform deployment

Since the client is built with Ionic, the app could technically be deployed to a variety of devices including Blackberry,
Android, iOS, and Windows devices.  It could even be run as a Web Application and accessed through a browser.
